    <h3>My Final Thoughts</h3>
    <p>Based on the required information and idea of what I expected to find pertaining the use of the given links, the search was quite fluid
        and very much easy to achieve, but while searching through I found that there were other jobs also included in the search which were partly
        desired from my search, while others just weren't, however, it did have the most important results showing at the top first before the not
        so important searche. The only question I have is, why can't companies be more open ahead of time on how their payment system works so as to
        give employees a proper understanding of what they're getting into?
