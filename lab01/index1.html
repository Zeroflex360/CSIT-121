        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1 1/2 sticks (12 tablespoons)</strong> of unsalted butter</li>
            <li><strong>4 cloves</strong>garlic, finely chopped</li>
            <li><strong>1 large</strong>soft Italian or French loaf</li>
            <li><strong>1/4 cup</strong>grated Parmesan</li>
            <li><strong>Kosher salt</strong></li>
            <li><strong>2 tablespoons</strong>flat-leaf parsley leaves, finely chopped</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Arrange a rack in the center of oven and preheat to 450 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Melt the butter in a small skillet over medium heat, add the garlic and cook, stirring occassionally, until the butter is golden and the garlic is very fragrant, about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Slice the bread in half lengthwise. Liberally brush the crust with the garlic butter. Turn the bread cut-side up. Slice each loaf crosswise at 2-inch intervals without cutting all
                the way through, making "pull apart" garlic bread. Liberally brush the cut sides of the bread with more garlic butter, spreading any remaining garlic evenly over the top. You should
                use all the garlic butter. Carefully transfer the bread to a rimmed baking sheet.
            </li>
            <li>Sprinkle the loaves with the Parmesan and a pinch of salt and bake until the edges of the bread are a deep golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Top with the parsley. Serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This is my favorite recipe because it's quite butter filled and seemingly positively intoxicating with the scent while being made but most importantly, it's delicious.</p>
